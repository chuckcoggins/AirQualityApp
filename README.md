# AirQualityApp
Django

This was my first attempt at a web application using Python and Django.
It is an Air Quality Checker by Zip Code application.

It opens in a web browser and you are able to type in your zip code and it will tell you what the weather is using the airnow.gov API.

We also used this app at our first attempt on using version control using gitbash.
That went ok as well. I will definitely need to look into version control a little bit more as I was having issues with my gitignore file not working correctly.
